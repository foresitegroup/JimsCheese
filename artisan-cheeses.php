  <strong>Holland's Family Cheese</strong><br>
  Marieke started making an authentic Dutch cheese on her farmstead in 2006. The Gouda is crafted from milk that is pumped directly from their milking parlor into the cheese vat... fresh and warm! This means the cheese is made without preheating or pasteurizing. After two hours of pressing into 18 pound wheels, the Gouda is placed in a salt-brine for 60 hours. From there, each wheel is moved to our special curing cellar to reach the ideal age...starting from smooth and creamy after 60 days to sharp and more complex flavors as the Gouda ages for three years or more.
