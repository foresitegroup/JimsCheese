Jim's Cheese has been distributing Wisconsin's Finest Cheese since 1955. Located in Waterloo, WI, our facility includes a cut and wrap operation, cheese waxing operation, gift box assembly, cold storage and corporate offices. Jim's Cheese started out with four wholesale customers and today services over 2,000 customers in 12 Midwest states. Our trucks provide direct store delivery to each of our customers and the personal service from our sales team to our retailers is something Jim's Cheese prides itself on.<br>

Our Lake Forest Artisan line consists of specialty, artisan and farmstead products from over 20 Wisconsin Cheese Makers. Specialty cheeses, as defined by the American Cheese Society, are cheeses made in a limited production, with particular attention paid to natural flavor and texture profiles. Specialty cheeses may be made from all types of milk (cow, sheep, goat) and often include flavorings such as herbs, spices, fruits and nuts.  The word "artisan" implies that a cheese is produced primarily by hand, in small batches, with particular attention paid to the tradition of the Cheese Maker's art, using as little mechanization as possible in the production of the cheese. Cheese classified as "farmstead," is made with milk from the farmer's own herd on the farm where the animals are raised.<br>

Many of the products that make up the Lake Forest Artisan line are also Award Winning. Wisconsin is known for performing well at cheese contests for example, at the 2012 American Cheese Society Cheese Contest Wisconsin captured one-third of all awards, earning 98 ribbons. Almost ten cheeses in the Lake Forest Artisan line have the proud honor of being made by a Master Cheesemaker. In order to be called a "Master Cheesemaker" a licensed cheesemaker needs to have been making a specific variety of cheese for at least 10 years and then complete a three year course to become certified as a Master for that specific variety of cheese. Wisconsin is the only state in the U.S. that has a Master Cheesemaker program.<br>

In 2010 Wisconsin's specialty cheese production was a total of 552 million lbs. which accounted for 46% of the total U.S. specialty cheese production (WI Dept. of Commerce). More and more retailers and restaurants are selling specialty cheese and Jim's Cheese is proud to distribute many of Wisconsin's Finest Specialty, Artisan and Farmstead cheeses. Our website features each of our Cheese Makers and highlights their unique story and products. Attached to our facility is a caf&eacute; and specialty cheese, Jim's Cheese Pantry. Be sure to visit us to check out the finest selection of Wisconsin cheese, craft beer and wine and enjoy one of our homemade sandwiches.
