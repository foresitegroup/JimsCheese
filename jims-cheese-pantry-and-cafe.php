<h1>Jim's Cheese Pantry &amp; Cafe</h1>

<img src="images/pantry_1.jpg" alt="" class="right">

In 1995 Jim's dream of a new retail store became a reality when he moved to our current location. Jim's retail structure consists of a deli, full service lunch counter and a selection of over 200 types of cheese and cheese cutouts.<br>
<br>

We can seat 30 customers in our country kitchen style cafe. As customers wait for their lunch, they can easily browse and sample the cold cases of cheeses, artisan cheeses and sausages.<br>
<br>

Product can be purchased directly through our retail store by calling 920-478-3600. We ship anywhere in the United States.<br>
